# Warpriest

Capable of calling upon the power of the gods in the form of blessings and spells, warpriests blend 
divine magic with martial skill. They are unflinching bastions of their faith, shouting gospel as 
they pummel foes into submission, and never shy away from a challenge to their beliefs. While 
clerics might be subtle and use diplomacy to accomplish their aims, warpriests aren’t above using 
violence whenever the situation warrants it. In many faiths, warpriests form the core of the 
church’s martial forces—reclaiming lost relics, rescuing captured clergy, and defending the 
church’s tenets from all challenges.

### Spellcasting

As a conduit of divine power, you can cast cleric Spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three Cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn 
additional cleric Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column 
of the Warpriest table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Warpriest table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st level and 
higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or highter. You 
regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

You prepare the list of warpriestSpells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the 
cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric Spells equal to your Wisdom modifier 
+ your warpriest level (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have 
Spell Slots.

You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of 
Spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each 
spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric Spells. The power of your Spells comes from 
your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability. In adition, you use your Wisdom modifier when settng the saving throw DC for 
a cleric spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.

  **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  
  **Spell Attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell 
prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy Symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric Spells.

### Divine Domain

{*Work in progress.*}

### Fervor

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to draw upon the power of your faith to heal wounds. You can 
also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in your struggles. This ability can be used 
a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your warpriest level + your Wisdom modifier. 

By expending this ability, the warpriest can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of damage, 
plus and additional 1d6 points of damage for every three warpriest levels you possess above 2nd (to 
a maximum of 7d6 at 20th level). Using this ability is an Action, unless you target yourself, in 
which case it's a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can use this ability to Turn Undead. Using 
fervor in this way is an Action.

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of this ability to cast any one warpriest spell you have 
prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target 
only yourself, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way 
ignore somatic components. You do not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.

#### Fervor: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead 
that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature 
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't 
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it 
can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one 
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As 
normal, you can't increase and ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action 
on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class.
